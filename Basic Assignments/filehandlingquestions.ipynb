Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life.

These are collectively known as the Royal Colleges, although not all currently use the term \"Royal\".

At present, some specialties of medicine do not fit easily into either of these categories, such as radiology, pathology, or anesthesia. Most of these have branched from one or other of the two camps above; for example anaesthesia developed first as a faculty of the Royal College of Surgeons (for which MRCS/FRCS would have been required) before becoming the Royal College of Anaesthetists and membership of the college is attained by sitting for the examination of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Anesthetists (FRCA).\\n', '\\n', 'Surgical specialty\\n', 'Main article: Surgery\\n', '\\n', 'Surgeons in an operating room\\n', 'Surgery is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum). Surgeons must also manage pre-operative, post-operative, and potential surgical candidates on the hospital wards.

A regularly recurring show is called a television series, and an individual segment of such a series is called an episode. Content is produced either in-house on a television stage with multiple cameras or produced by contract with film production companies. Episodes are usually broadcast in annual sets, which are called seasons in North America and series in other regions. A one-off television show may be called a television special, while a show with a limited number of episodes is a miniseries.[a] A television film, or telefilm, is a feature film produced for broadcast by a terrestrial or cable network.\\n', '\\n', 'Television shows by terrestrial and cable networks are most often scheduled for broadcast ahead of time and appear on electronic guides or other TV listings. The rise of streaming television, however, has made television schedules less relevant than in earlier decades. Some programming may be aired live—that is, events are broadcast at the time they happen rather than at a later time or date—but the vast majority of programming is produced ahead of time. Originally, viewers had no practical way to record a show for later viewing; this changed with the advent of home video, first in the form of videotape recorded on VCRs and later in the form of digital video recorders. Cable television providers began offering certain programming \"pay-per-view\" or on-demand, with viewers paying a one-time fee to watch a program at a time of their own choosing. Streaming television allows viewers to watch programming at any time with a subscription to the service.\\n', '\\n', 'History\\n', 'Main article: History of television\\n', 'The first television shows were experimental, sporadic broadcasts viewable only within a very short range from the broadcast tower starting in the 1930s.

The 1947 World Series inspired many Americans to buy their first television set, and then in 1948, the popular radio show Texaco Star Theater made the move and became the first weekly televised variety show, earning host Milton Berle the name \"Mr. Television\", and demonstrating that the medium was a stable, modern form of entertainment that could attract advertisers. The first national live television broadcast in the US took place on September 4, 1951, when President Harry Truman\\'s speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over AT&T\\'s transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets.[5][6][7]\\n', '\\n', 'The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) in the US occurred on January 1, 1954.

Due to this, the episodes could be broadcast in any order.[citation needed] Since the 1980s, many series feature progressive change in the plot, the characters, or both. For instance, Hill Street Blues and St. Elsewhere were two of the first US prime time drama television series to have this kind of dramatic structure,[8][better source needed] while the later series Babylon 5 further exemplifies such structure in that it had a predetermined story running over its intended five-season run.[citation needed]\\n\", '\\n', 'In 2012, it was reported that television was growing into a larger component of major media companies\\' revenues than film.[9] Some also noted the increase in quality of some television programs.

During the Olympics, Home and Away would often go on hiatus, which was referred to as an \"Olympic cliffhanger\". Therefore, the number of episodes would decrease. Australian situation comedy series\\' seasons are approximately 13 episodes long and premiere any time between February and November.\\n', '\\n', \"British television programmes have tended toward shorter series in recent years. For example, the first series of long-running science fiction show Doctor Who in 1963 featured forty-two 25‑minute episodes, and continued with a similar number each year until it was reduced to twenty-five for 1970 to accommodate changes in production and significantly reducing the actors' workload) and continued to 1984. For 1985 fewer but longer episodes were shown, but even after a return to shorter episodes in 1986, lack of support within the BBC meant fewer episodes were commissioned leading to only fourteen 25‑minute episodes up to those in 1989 after which it was cancelled. The revival of Doctor Who from 2005 has comprised thirteen 45‑minute installments.\\n\", '\\n', 'There are some series in the UK that have a larger number of episodes, for example Waterloo Road started with 8 to 12 episodes, but from series three onward it increased to twenty episodes and series seven will contain 30 episodes. Recently, US non-cable networks have also begun to experiment with shorter series for some programs, particularly reality shows, such as Survivor. They often air two series per year, resulting in roughly the same number of episodes per year as a drama.\\n', '\\n', 'This is a reduction from the 1950s, in which many US shows (e.g. Gunsmoke) had between 29 and 39 episodes per season. Actual storytelling time within a commercial television hour has also gradually reduced over the years, from 50 minutes out of every 60 to the current 44 (and even less on some networks), beginning in the early 21st century.\\n', '\\n', 'The usage of \"season\" and \"series\" differ for DVD and Blu-ray releases in both Australia and the UK. In Australia, many locally produced shows are termed differently on home video releases. For example, a set of the television drama series Packed to the Rafters or Wentworth is referred to as \"season\" (\"The Complete First Season\", etc.), whereas drama series such as Tangle are known as a \"series\" (\"Series 1\", etc.). British-produced programmes such as Mrs. Brown\\'s Boys are referred to as \"season\" in Australia for the DVD and Blu-ray releases.\\n', '\\n', \"In the UK and Ireland, most programmes are referred to as 'series' while 'season' is starting to be used for some US and international releases.\\n\", '\\n', 'Egypt\\n', 'The 1980s and 1990s was the golden age of television miniseries attracting millions of Egyptians. For example, The Family of Mr Shalash miniseries, starring Salah Zulfikar and Laila Taher, was the highest rated at the time.[34]\\n', '\\n', 'Running time\\n', 'In the United States, dramas produced for hour-long time slots typically are 37–42 minutes in length (excluding advertisements), while sitcoms produced for 30-minute time slots typically are 18–21 minutes long. There are exceptions: subscription-based cable TV channels, such as HBO, Starz, Cinemax, and Showtime, have episodes that are 45–48 minutes long, similar to the UK. Audience opinions of length have varied due to factors such as content overload.[35]\\n', '\\n', 'In Britain, dramas typically run from 46–48 minutes on commercial channels, and 57–59 minutes on the BBC. Half-hour programs are around 22 minutes on commercial channels and around 28 minutes on the BBC. The longer duration on the BBC is due to the lack of advertising breaks.\\n', '\\n', 'In France, most television shows (whether dramas, game shows or documentaries) have a duration of 52 minutes. This is the same on nearly all French networks (TF1, France 2, France 5, M6, Canal+, etc.).[36]\\n', '\\n', 'The episode runtime of television shows produced for streaming platforms, such as Netflix and Hulu, can vary from just under 30 minutes to over one hour long.[37][38] Internet-based series with episode runtimes of less than 25 minutes are considered web series.[37]']\n",
